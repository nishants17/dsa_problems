I am looking to approach the Data Structures Problem Solving methodically by working on certain data structures and patterns first.

These are the following data structures that I have explored so far:
1. Arrays
2. Hash Maps



These are the following problem solving patterns that I have explored so far:
1. Two Pointers
2. Sorting
